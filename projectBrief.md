# Team Car Racing

## Overview

Team Car Racing is a car racing simulation built in Unity, where cars can be controlled either by human players or by a python program that can use AI. The Unity simulation serves as the environment for training and testing AI driving behavior.The simulation also includes a network listener that allows external AI programs to control vehicles, making it suitable for neural network integration. Using camera sensors, along with speed and steering inputs, the simulation will send environment observations and listen to controls. Simulation will have realistic vehicle physics like downforce effects, surface dependent wheel friction, and breaking. The game includes functional mirrors to see cars behind. Several pre-made racing tracks are provided for AI training, built from modular road tiles that can also be combined to create new custom tracks.
